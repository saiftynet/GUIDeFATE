Olivier Lahaye suggeted a restructure to enable easier installation

a/ create a directory named support_files (or what ever matches the things that are not part of the package but that are still usefull)
b/ move src/{Makefile.PL,debian,perl-GUIDeFATE.spec.in} to ./
c/ move TestEnvironment to support files
d/ move WXPerlImagick to support_files
e/ move *.jpg *.png ./Images
f/ move Images to support_files
g/ Clean duplicates between ./Examples and ./src/scripts
h/ not sure that Old Versions shouldbe in git repo. Maybe put that in packages? Note that you can tag your releases
i/ src/license.txt is redundant with /LICENSE

In My Humble Opinion (you decide), Ideally, once cleaned up, your repo should look like this in /

Examples
Support_files/WxPerlImagick
Support_files/TestEnvironment
SupportFiles/Win32. 
(maybe handle that in Makefile.PL would be better: depending on OS, the correct file is chosen)
Support_Files/Images

LICENSE
README.md
INSTALL (from src/README keeping only install stuffs as the other parts are redundant with README.md)
MANIFEST.stub (from src/MANIFEST.stub)
Makefile.PM (from src)
lib/* (from src)
man/GUIDeFATE.pod (from src, needs MANIFEST.stub update)
